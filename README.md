# Job Tracker

I am creating a **Job Tracker** application using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It helps users manage and track their job applications efficiently.

## Upcoming Features

- Add, edit, and delete job applications.
- Track the status of applications (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Offered, Rejected).
- Add notes for each application.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Persist data to localstorage

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling.
- **Localstorage**: For data persistance.
